# BitDrawToken

BitDraw.online is a smart lottery platform created for the $103 billion lottery industry which will replace traditional lottery methods using disruptive technology while providing 100% anonymity for consumers

The lottery industry is one of the biggest in the world. Despite the impressive figures, banks and financial institutions have road-blocked businesses and individuals in the industry making payments expensive and insecure.

The BitDraw solution will solve three major problems for businesses, individuals and consumers of the lottery industry: eliminate large fees, guarantee security of funds and provide 100% anonymous transactions.

BitDraw will be managed by entrepreneurs and businessmen from the lottery industry. Their extensive experience is coupled with financial specialists and blockchain experts. Together we are going to set up a strong foundation for a platform which can change payment systems for every lottery industry participant.

Token sale will take place between the 23rd of August 2018 to 29th of November 2018. The sale will take place through the official website BitDraw.online. The company will burn any unsold tokens which would instantly increase the value of BitDraw. We are in discussion with traditional lottery industry to use our platform and have already pledged to use BitDraw upon its launch.

Smart contract is published in Ethereum blockchain.
